      '大众社会出现，新闻报道摄影便因大众传播这种历史性要求而得到了确立之后，现代摄影就发生了巨大的变化。尤其是国家权力在背后充分提供支持的时候，新闻报道摄影充分发挥了它的功能。像巨型蟾蜍一般膨胀的国家，选择了更直接地指示事物的摄影，让它成为了一种煽动、操纵大众的手段。'

      'Dashwood Books and Session Press are pleased to announce the release of Daido Moriyama Shashin Jidai 1981–1988 by renowned Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama. With the publication of his serialized photo-essay Hikari to Kage (Light and Shadow) in the first issues of the magazine, Shashin Jidai, Daido Moriyama announced his return to photography after nearly a decade. Moriyama had been mired in an acute creative slump from his mid thirties, since the publication of his seminal book, Shashin yo Sayonara (Farewell Photography) in 1972. Unable to take nearly any photos for a prolonged period, he turned to illicit drugs, ultimately wasting away to little more than 40 kgs before he hit physical and emotional rock bottom. Lured back by Akira Hasegawa, Shashin Jidai’s editor, he was invited to contribute photographs for each issue. This began a long relationship between Moriyama and Shashin Jidai. He would ultimately make a total of six serialized essays that appeared through sixty-three issues (in every issue but one) until its’ demise in April 1988. During this period Moriyama worked almost exclusively for Shasin Jidai and was given a free hand to explore and experiment and in the process evolved a new aesthetic that still informs his photography today. Tragically, more than eighty percent of his negatives were lost from this pivotal body of work. In Daido Moriyama Shashin Jidai 1981–1988 the complete run of essays or chapters that appeared concurrently in Shashin Jidai are brought together for the first time, representing the only way to appreciate them without acquiring the original magazines themselves. Each complete essay is reproduced alongside a selected portfolio of images and written essays by Moriyama from each chapter as they appeared in the original magazines. Text appears in Japanese with English translation. In over 400 pages it provides access to a pivotal period in the evolution of one of the most revered and influential photographers of the twentieth century, as yet undocumented in book-form. Accompanying there is a short essay “The Photo Age: Daido Moriyama and Shashin Jidai” by Kotaro Iizawa. Translation throughout by Daniel González, Essays by Daido Moriyama, Text by Kotaro Iizawa, Design by Geoff Han, Editing by David Strettell and Miwa Susuda.'

      'Session Press is pleased to present Solace, the first U.S. monograph by acclaimed Hong Kong based photographer and film director, Wing Shya.',
      'Early in his career, Shya was invited by Wong Kar-wai to serve as an on-set stills photographer for films including Happy Together and In the Mood for Love. Granted rare access to the renowned director’s inner circle, over the years Shya captured poignant behind-the-scenes portraits of iconic actors such as Tony Leung, Leslie Cheung, Maggie Cheung, and Gong Li in unguarded moments between takes. These intimate images form the heart of Solace, interspersed with the best of Shya’s commercial shoots, as well as private snapshots of nature and cityscapes encountered on his travels. The resulting collection is a true testament to Shya’s ability as an eloquent storyteller and deeply introspective observer.',
      'Hong Kong has long captured the West’s imagination as an enigmatic Other with dazzling neon lights and a chaotic electric pulse. However, in Solace, Shya reveals a more personal and meditative Hong Kong. Time slows, inviting the viewer to explore the subtleties of interpersonal chemistries from a distance in ephemeral, quiet moments that showcase Shya’s sensitive and intuitive approach toward his subjects. A nostalgic, dreamlike atmosphere emerges in his expired and exposed film, punctuated by flashes of vibrant color.',
      'In the words of William Chang, one of Wong Kar-wai’s most important collaborators, Solace is a “moving achievement that deftly captures ephemeral postures and fleeting snippets in time.”',
      'We hope Solace will introduce an international audience to the sublime nuance of Wing Shya’s work, as well as the rich history and culture of Hong Kong as seen through his eyes.'

    author: 'BFI',
    description: [
      'Like her filmography, which encompasses rigorously avantgarde cinema, musicals, comedies and much else, the traces Akerman left of herself in her films are wildly various. In a nifty piece of anti-self-portraiture, Chantal Akerman by Chantal Akerman (1997, made for the French TV series Cinéma, de notre temps), the director reflects on the impossibility of making a film about herself when she is commissioned to do so. “I’m an unreliable storyteller… honesty is artificial,” she tells the camera. In an interview with Nicole Brenez in 2011, Akerman would go further, warning against “rifling through [her] autobiography. It’s imprisoning.'

      '在由 “纯情商店街” 和 “北中通” 两条主道编织起来的中心商区里，菜场、酒馆和日用百货铺散发出令人怀念的市井烟火气，让我差点要误信了这里只是东京 23 区里一处普通居民区，而不是那个曾经爆发过一万五千人反核大游行的地方。然而再往里走几步，种种异样感便涌上心头：绚丽夸张的卷帘门涂鸦、透着亮粉色灯光的诡异橱窗、驮着猫头鹰走来走去的嬉皮、眼花缭乱的青年向店铺…… 这绝不是老化、萧条的地方商店街会有的模样！我可以在此轻易地嗅到种种新鲜的、不安稳的气息，却又惊异地意识到，这些充满意外性的元素，似乎正是此处日常的一部分。此情此景让我想起的，是《致我们的朋友》一书的引言：“另一个世界并不存在。只有另一种生活的方式。（雅克・梅林）”'
