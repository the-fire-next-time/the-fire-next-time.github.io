    author: 'Daido Moriyama',
    description: [
      'Dashwood Books and Session Press are pleased to announce the release of Daido Moriyama Shashin Jidai 1981–1988 by renowned Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama. With the publication of his serialized photo-essay Hikari to Kage (Light and Shadow) in the first issues of the magazine, Shashin Jidai, Daido Moriyama announced his return to photography after nearly a decade. Moriyama had been mired in an acute creative slump from his mid thirties, since the publication of his seminal book, Shashin yo Sayonara (Farewell Photography) in 1972. Unable to take nearly any photos for a prolonged period, he turned to illicit drugs, ultimately wasting away to little more than 40 kgs before he hit physical and emotional rock bottom. Lured back by Akira Hasegawa, Shashin Jidai’s editor, he was invited to contribute photographs for each issue. This began a long relationship between Moriyama and Shashin Jidai. He would ultimately make a total of six serialized essays that appeared through sixty-three issues (in every issue but one) until its’ demise in April 1988. During this period Moriyama worked almost exclusively for Shasin Jidai and was given a free hand to explore and experiment and in the process evolved a new aesthetic that still informs his photography today. Tragically, more than eighty percent of his negatives were lost from this pivotal body of work. In Daido Moriyama Shashin Jidai 1981–1988 the complete run of essays or chapters that appeared concurrently in Shashin Jidai are brought together for the first time, representing the only way to appreciate them without acquiring the original magazines themselves. Each complete essay is reproduced alongside a selected portfolio of images and written essays by Moriyama from each chapter as they appeared in the original magazines. Text appears in Japanese with English translation. In over 400 pages it provides access to a pivotal period in the evolution of one of the most revered and influential photographers of the twentieth century, as yet undocumented in book-form. Accompanying there is a short essay “The Photo Age: Daido Moriyama and Shashin Jidai” by Kotaro Iizawa. Translation throughout by Daniel González, Essays by Daido Moriyama, Text by Kotaro Iizawa, Design by Geoff Han, Editing by David Strettell and Miwa Susuda.'

      'Session Press is pleased to present Solace, the first U.S. monograph by acclaimed Hong Kong based photographer and film director, Wing Shya.',
      'Early in his career, Shya was invited by Wong Kar-wai to serve as an on-set stills photographer for films including Happy Together and In the Mood for Love. Granted rare access to the renowned director’s inner circle, over the years Shya captured poignant behind-the-scenes portraits of iconic actors such as Tony Leung, Leslie Cheung, Maggie Cheung, and Gong Li in unguarded moments between takes. These intimate images form the heart of Solace, interspersed with the best of Shya’s commercial shoots, as well as private snapshots of nature and cityscapes encountered on his travels. The resulting collection is a true testament to Shya’s ability as an eloquent storyteller and deeply introspective observer.',
      'Hong Kong has long captured the West’s imagination as an enigmatic Other with dazzling neon lights and a chaotic electric pulse. However, in Solace, Shya reveals a more personal and meditative Hong Kong. Time slows, inviting the viewer to explore the subtleties of interpersonal chemistries from a distance in ephemeral, quiet moments that showcase Shya’s sensitive and intuitive approach toward his subjects. A nostalgic, dreamlike atmosphere emerges in his expired and exposed film, punctuated by flashes of vibrant color.',
      'In the words of William Chang, one of Wong Kar-wai’s most important collaborators, Solace is a “moving achievement that deftly captures ephemeral postures and fleeting snippets in time.”',
      'We hope Solace will introduce an international audience to the sublime nuance of Wing Shya’s work, as well as the rich history and culture of Hong Kong as seen through his eyes.'

    author: 'BFI',
    description: [
      'Like her filmography, which encompasses rigorously avantgarde cinema, musicals, comedies and much else, the traces Akerman left of herself in her films are wildly various. In a nifty piece of anti-self-portraiture, Chantal Akerman by Chantal Akerman (1997, made for the French TV series Cinéma, de notre temps), the director reflects on the impossibility of making a film about herself when she is commissioned to do so. “I’m an unreliable storyteller… honesty is artificial,” she tells the camera. In an interview with Nicole Brenez in 2011, Akerman would go further, warning against “rifling through [her] autobiography. It’s imprisoning.'

    title: 'Three Moments of a Script That Never Was Written but Might Have Happened',
    author: 'Hu Wei',
    description: [
      'This publication departs from three video works by the artist Hu Wei, exploring the possibilities of devising new scripts within the manifold connections between materials for creative works, images, and texts. The first part of the publication transcribes and recompiles the narrations in his videos into three sets of juxtaposed scripts. Each of these textual fragments showcases an “anatomical section of an era” from disparate geopolitical contexts: a family letter from Sabah, a set of Rashomonian testimony, and an anecdote about the anonymous. The second part is a notebook-like atlas that unfolds following the clues of three keywords: “Fabrication,” “Anonymity,” and “Boundary.” Within this section, different types of images and texts, including factual materials, embodied research and survey records, as well as fabricated documents, interlace with each other. They serve as an interrogation, extension, reconstruction, and reassemblage of three muted histories or events.'

    title: 'Minnan Exit 不辞而别',
    author: 'Wen-You Cai',
    description: [
      "Since 2015, Wen-You Cai has returned on multiple occasions to her parents' hometown of Quanzhou, Fujian, to attend the funerals of her deceased relatives. The ceremonies in the Minnan region unfold like grand dramas in which she is both an observer and a participant. Throughout the ceremony, Wen-You is enveloped in the unknown; everything seems meticulously arranged. Amidst the overwhelming grief of losing loved ones, there exists a feeling of confusion, and taking photographs was one of the ways for her to engage in the funeral process. For this photo series, Wen-You was initially confronted by her own fear of death, intertwined with her bewilderment and curiosity about the complex funeral rituals and its uniqueness inherent to Minnan culture. To demystify these subjects, Wen-You, joined by te editions, interviewed a funeral director who provides comprehensive “one-stop services,” a monk who hosts Buddhist ceremonies, and a folklorist of Minnan rituals. Minnan Exit can be interpreted as many things–a family album, a curated collection of photographs, an unfinished journey of discovery, as well as the process of  Wen-You's reconciliation with her mortality. Minnan Exit was designed by an independent graphic design studio, RELATED DEPARTMENT. Through the artist's lens, the design team sought inspiration from funeral objects and rituals, to create a visual concept for the publication's structure and layout with the regional characteristics of Minnan."

    description: [
      "Much in our life at this moment is often marked by an absence of clarity. Many have experienced a malaise and come to know its persistence. We seem to have become used to stasis and theoretical discussions, lingering in silence and hoping from time to time for something extraordinary to happen. Yet it might also have been a blessing; an opportunity to free ourselves from overarching narratives, to direct our attention to the individual, the local, and to subjects that have long been part of our own lives—a more agile, intuitive mindset. The third issue of te magazine took shape in this context, and chose to confront experiences of “plight”—plight of the persecuted, of the artists, of the forgotten, and of those living with colonial legacies. How might we, as individuals, transmute plights in order to learn to live in this world? If each piece in this issue can be said to propose a mode of healing, the aim is not only about specific pathologies, but rather to recommend adjustments and defenses in moments of crisis. While writing on the plights of others, the authors also look inward for the roots of questions that they have long harbored about their own experiences. As introduced by Jacques Lacan, the theory of “the mirror stage” refers to children's initial awareness of their own existence. As adults, we continue to grapple with the process of self-discovery and understanding, at times feeling trapped deeply in the “mirror.” This issue’s theme, Mirroring represents a continuous exploration of the self. On the one hand, these pieces document the processes of setbacks, negating, questioning and reconciling; on the other, delineate the self through the other, a process discernible in several jointly-authored pieces in this issue, where a special connection and sense of fellowship formed through dialogue, correspondence, and collaborative research. In Siddhartha, Hermann Hesse described how the protagonist's worldview was shaped through seeking and struggle, and we hear in it an echo of the inspiration behind this issue of te: “But now, his liberated eyes stayed on this side, he saw and became aware of the visible, sought to be at home in this world, did not search for the true essence, did not aim at a world beyond.” 1",
      '[1] Siddhartha by H. Hesse, translated by Hilda Rosner, Bantam Books,1971.'

    description: [
      "The exhibition Prosodic Grains at BY ART MATTERS (天目里美术馆) draws inspiration from Chinese literature's pursuit of natural law and balanced beauty in phonology. It features works from over a dozen artists across different countries and regions, exploring the origins, elasticity, and limitations of human communication. For individuals, language and music carry fleeting emotions and thoughts; for human communities, they embody living histories and shared memories that reside in our collective consciousness. Embracing this holistic vision, the exhibition weaves individual breaths into the tapestry of global currents, embarking on a journey that awakens synesthetic sensations and delves into the realms of listening, perception, and resonance. In this information age, where attention fragments amidst discord and conflict, perhaps by experiencing and conveying the ineffable rhythmic beauty that transcends time and space, we can guide people back to their primal yearning for connection and mutual understanding.",
      "The publication Prosodic Notes emerges from the exhibition but isn't strictly bound by its concepts—it can be viewed as an alternative aspect of the exhibition. We have constantly asked ourselves since the very beginning of this project: How should we represent an exhibition so deeply engaged with auditory experience through text and still images? How can the publication maintain independence from the exhibition? However, we realized that the rustling of turning pages, the dynamic visual design elements, and the tactile sensation of paper are also meant to reactivate our senses.",
      `As we shaped this publication, we maintained an open dialogue with artists around the question: "How can works that pulse with sound and language find new life within the bounds of pages?" Some content consists of the original creations by artists. Another thread weaves in the artists' journeys toward their final works, including sketches, notes, archives, and interviews. These elements serve as passageways connecting living memories and experiences of the exhibition. "Notes" carries dual meaning—both written observations and musical notation. The former emphasizes process, while the latter suggests that even the minutiae within the book are like musical notes on paper. The harmonies, collisions, and fusions they create are precisely what we hope to echo with the readers. These contents flow freely, transcending editorial boundaries, inviting readers to drift upon their currents and discover their own interpretations.`

    description: [
      'Dance in Herland surveys artist Luka Yuanyuan Yang’s cinematic oeuvre, including her feature-length production Chinatown Cha-Cha and five short films centered on diasporic Chinese communities. The book picks up where the films end, serving as both a reflection and a complement, while also creating a new narrative. The book brings together hundreds of archival materials from photo albums, rare and invaluable oral histories, creative writings, and interviews with scholars. Over nearly a year of editing, we felt like revisiting 20th-century San Francisco and Cuba, tracing history through the neons of Chinatown and the echoes of Cantonese opera. For the dancers and performers documented in this book, their bodies act as living archives; their memories and unspoken emotions may be concealed in their steps, fingertips, and gazes.',
      'Additionally, the design duo Studio Pianpian He and Max Harvey transformed the books into a vessel of collective memory through their design. They used papers in various colors to separate different oral history backgrounds. The designers delicately captured visual elements marked by the era from the archive, infusing the book with new charm grounded in the aesthetics of the last century.'

    title: 'Ground Sea 地浪',
    author: 'Kanthy Peng, Geng Yao',
    description: [
      'Kanthy Peng’s debut artist book, Ground Sea, weaves a visual narrative exploring depression, memory, and loss through 73 photographs. The title takes inspiration from an archaic West Indian term, which anthropologist and feminist Emily Martin used to capture her sensations when observing the Affective Disorder Clinical Rounds, “(Ground-sea is the name) for a swell of the ocean, which occurs in calm weather and without obvious cause, breaking on the shore in heavy roaring billows. A distant storm, out of sight, is often the cause of a ground-sea.”',
      'In Ground Sea, Peng re-orchestrates photographs spanning over a decade and multiple projects into a new diptych-structured work. The first part, Sunset Watchers, unfolds through black-and-white portraits of three women reenacting a phantom folktale following the 1896 tsunami in Japan—images that also allude to the anxious premonition of those living with depression. Interspersed colored photographs recall Peng’s bodily memory of being bedridden due to illness. The second part, Kuāfù Chases The Sun, carries stills from two video works about Peng’s father, who retired from the People’s Liberation Army ten years after his daughter left home. In these images, his body is constantly propelled forward by the cogs of a system, breaking the stagnation of the first part, only to fall into nothingness ultimately.',
      `The book also features two poems by poet Geng Yao. One pays tribute to a mutual friend of Yao and Peng; the other reflects on the struggle for social mobility through the lens of China’s “small-town swot” phenomenon, resonating in parallel with the book’s imagery. The design engages with the flux of the visual narrative through calibrated shifts in graphic and material density. In an attempt to reflect a concern of the artist, of highlighting the physical experience of depression over its pathology, the design treats text as image and image as matter. The book unfolds through fading, interruption, and repetition, ending with a long scene of the artist’s father running toward a vanishing point.`,
      'Peng likens the depressed body to a receptor and amplifier of signals from the future, much like the camera she holds in her hands. In the tension between stillness and motion, waiting and chasing, the book poses a question: Are those paralyzed by the impending catastrophe in need of treatment, or is it the society—numbed by its relentless pursuit of progress—that requires awakening?'
